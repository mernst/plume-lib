## Monolithic plume-lib: a library of utilities for programming

**Monolithic plume-lib is obsolete!**</b>  This package, called monolithic
plume-lib, is *obsolete*.  As of August 2018, it has been split
into [many smaller packages](https://github.com/plume-lib/)
Each one is smaller and more focused.
 * The [Java libraries](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.plumelib) are conveniently available from the Maven Central Repository.
 * Obtain the Java programs, and the non-Java libraries and programs, from their repositories.

The old documentation for monolithic plume-lib is still available:
 * in file docs/index.html , or
 * at the plume-lib homepage: https://mernst.github.io/plume-lib/
