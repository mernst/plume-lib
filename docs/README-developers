This readme is intended for plume-lib developers.
The main plume-lib documentation is in file README.html .


--Making a release--

To make a plume-lib release and upload it to GitHub:

1. Commit or stash any changes in your copy of the plume-lib repository.

2. Visit URLs in ../java/lib/README to determine if more recent .jar files
for ../java/lib/ are available.  If so, replace the out-of-date one.
Update file names in files java/.classpath and (in 2 places) java/Makefile .

3. Ensure that file index.html documents any new files.
To find new files, do

    git diff --name-status v`cat VERSION` | grep '^A'

4. Update file changelog.txt
To help writing the changelog text, see the log and/or diffs, using one of:

    git log --name-status v`cat VERSION`..HEAD
    git diff v`cat VERSION`...HEAD

5. Update the VERSION file.

6. Commit and push the changes in your copy of the plume-lib repository.

    git push

7. Wait about 2.5 hours and ensure that Travis jobs pass:
at least plume-lib, plume-lib-typecheck, daikon, and daikon-typecheck.
The following commands will open the URLs in your browser.

    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/mernst/plume-lib
    sleep 1
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/codespecs/daikon
    sleep 1
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/typetests/plume-lib-typecheck
    sleep 1
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/typetests/daikon-typecheck

8. Run the make-plume-release script located in bin:

    cd ..
    export JAVAC=$CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin-devel/javac
    bin/make-plume-release `cat docs/VERSION`

The script requires that $JAVAC or 'javac' point to the JSR 308 compiler.
If this is the case, then the release is built and the test cases are run.
The release will be compatible with Java 7, but don't try to use a Java 7
JDK when making the release.

9. Push the new Git tag created by the script to the repository:

    git push --tags

10. Make a new release on GitHub.
The exact steps are displayed at the end of the make-plume-release script. They
are repeated below, but you must replace x.y.z with the correct version number.
 * browse to https://github.com/mernst/plume-lib/releases/new
 * set tag to vx.y.z
 * Release title is: plume-lib version x.y.z
 * description from docs/changelog.txt, with hard line breaks removed
 * attach plume-lib-x.y.z.tar.gz

11. Update the web version of the Javadoc.  On a machine connected to the UW
CSE file system:

    cd plume-lib/java
    git pull
    make javadoc-publish
    $pl/bin/checklink -q -r `grep -v '^#' $pl/bin/checklink-args.txt` https://types.cs.washington.edu/plume-lib/

This step can be done even without making a new release.
