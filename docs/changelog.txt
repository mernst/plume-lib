plume-lib 1.1.1, released ??

The plume-lib homepage has moved to https://mernst.github.io/plume-lib/

plume-lib is being gradually split up into multiple smaller projects.
 * https://github.com/plume-lib/run-google-java-format

===========================================================================

plume-lib 1.1.0, released August 17, 2016

Programs run-google-java-format.py and check-google-java-format.py are
wrappers for the google-java-format program.  That program creates poor
formatting for annotations, particularly for type annotations and for
annotations in comments.  The run-google-java-format.py wrapper runs
google-java-format and then improves formatting of annotations.  The
check-google-java-format.py wrapper reports any files that would be
reformatted by run-google-java-format.py program, and returns non-zero
status if there were any.

Deprecated the search program in favor of ag.  ag is faster.  A limitation
of ag is that, contrary to its documentation, it does not search within
archives such as .zip and .tar files.  It also does not respect .gitignore
files in parent directories.

plume.jar no longer contains the contents of junit.jar.  JUnit is needed to
run plume-lib's tests, but is not needed at run time.  This reduces the
size of plume.jar and avoids conflicts with clients' assumptions about JUnit.

Consolidated documentation into the docs/ subdirectory.  Previously, some
was in the gh-pages branch and some was in the root directory.

===========================================================================

===========================================================================

plume-lib 1.0.8, released January 12, 2016

Plume-lib includes a newer version of BCEL.
If you receive an error such as the following:
    "BCEL must be in the classpath.  Normally it is found in daikon.jar."
then the problem is most likely that your classpath contains a previous
version of daikon.jar or plume.jar.

===========================================================================

plume-lib 1.0.7, released January 1, 2016

New program: trigger-travis.sh.  Trigger a new Travis-CI job. This is
useful for triggering a dependent build: invoke this in the
"after-success:" block of repository A's .travis.yml file, so that if
Travis job A succeeds, then Travis job B is run next.

New Java library: plume.DeterministicObject.  A version of Object with a
deterministic hashCode() method.  Instantiate this instead of Object to
remove a source of nondeterminism from your programs.

Many third-party library jar files updated to newer versions.

The Java portion of plume-lib now requires Java 7.

The Python portion of plume-lib now works with Python 2 or Python 3.

Many other bug fixes and enhancements.
