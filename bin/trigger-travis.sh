# Trigger a new Travis-CI job.
# Usage:
#   trigger-travis.sh GITHUBID GITHUBPROJECT TRAVISTOKEN [MESSAGE]

# To use this script to trigger a dependent build in Travis, do two things:
# 
# 1. Set an environment variable TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN by navigating to
#   https://travis-ci.org/MYGITHUBID/MYGITHUBPROJECT/settings
# The environment variable will be set when Travis runs the job,
# but won't be visible to anyone browsing https://travis-ci.org/.
# Determine the value for TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN via: travis login && travis token
# (You may need to first do:
#    sudo apt-get install ruby-dev && sudo gem install travis
# Don't do "sudo apt-get install travis" which installs a trajectory analyzer.)
# This differs from the token available at https://travis-ci.org/profile .
# 
# 2. Add the following after_success block to your .travis.yml file,
# where you replace OTHERGITHUB* by a specific downstream project,
# but you leave $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN and $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG as literal text:
#
# after_success:
#   - curl -LO https://raw.github.com/mernst/plume-lib/master/bin/trigger-travis.sh
#   - sh trigger-travis.sh OTHERGITHUBID OTHERGITHUBPROJECT $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN

# There are two caveats to calling this in the "after_success:" block.
#
# 1. Travis does not fail a job if an after_success command fails.  If you
# misspell a GitHub ID or project name, then this script will fail, but
# Travis won't inform you of the mistake.  So, check the end of the Travis
# buid log the first time that a build succeeds.
#
# 2. This second point is relevant only if your .travis.yml defines a build
# matrix (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Build-Matrix)
# that runs the same job using different configurations.
# The "after_success:" block is run once for every build in the matrix, but
# you only want it to run once if all the builds in the matrix succeed.  For
# a workaround, see https://github.com/dmakhno/travis_after_all , but I
# couldn't get its permissions to work and don't know why.  A hack is to have
# only the first job in the matrix trigger downstream builds.  This isn't
# perfect, because the downstream job is triggered even if some job other
# than the first one fails.  However, it is simple and it works.  Write in
# your .travis.yml file:
#
# after_success:
#   # The vertical bar (pipe) means multi-line command in YAML.
#   - |
#       if [[ "$TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER" == *.1 ]] ; then
#         curl -LO https://raw.github.com/mernst/plume-lib/master/bin/trigger-travis.sh
#         sh trigger-travis.sh OTHERGITHUBID OTHERGITHUBPROJECT $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN
#       fi

# An alternative to this script would be to install the Travis command-line
# client and then run:
#   travis restart -r OTHERGITHUBID/OTHERGITHUBPROJECT
# That is undesirable because it restarts an old job, destroying its history,
# rather than starting a new job which is our goal.

# Parts of this script were originally taken from
# http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds/
