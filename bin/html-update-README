The "html-update" package contains three small scripts that you may find
helpful for automatically updating your webpages.

html-toc automatically creates a table of contents for a webpage.
	Users do not typically call this script directly.
html-update-toc updates the webpage, if its table of contents differs
	from that generated by html-toc.
html-update-link-dates updates webpage text that refers to the date
	and/or size of a linked-to file.  Requires checkargs.pm.

For an example of use of both html-update-toc and html-update-link-dates, see
http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/software/.  For an example of the size
feature of html-update-link-dates, see http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/download/.

You can make Emacs automatically run html-update-toc to update HTML tables
of contents, whenever a file is saved.  To do so, add
  (load-library "html-update")
to your .emacs file.
