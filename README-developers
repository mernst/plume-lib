This readme is intended for plume-lib developers.
The main plume-lib documentation is in file README.html .


--Making a release--

To make a plume-lib release and upload it to GitHub:

1. Commit or stash any changes in your copy of the plume-lib repository.

2. For each .jar file in java/lib/, if a more recent version is available,
replace the out-of-date one.  Update file names in files java/.classpath and
(in 2 places) java/Makefile .  For checker-qual.jar, update java/lib/README .

3. Browse to each URL in bin/checklink-args.txt and remove any
that are not valid.
Something like this could work (to avoid doing all of the URLs in one go,
which might overpower your browser):
  (defun browse-url-checklink (number-prefix)
    (find-file "bin/checklink-args.txt")
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (browse-url-once-if-matched (concat number-prefix ":\\(http.*\\)") 1))
  (browse-url-checklink "0")
  (browse-url-checklink "1")
  (browse-url-checklink "2")
  (browse-url-checklink "3")
  (browse-url-checklink "4")
  (browse-url-checklink "5")
  (browse-url-checklink "6")
  (browse-url-checklink "[^0-6]")

4. Ensure that the main documentation at index.html in the gh-pages branch
documents any new files.  To find new files, do

    git diff --name-status v`cat VERSION` | grep '^A'

5. Update changelog.txt and VERSION.
To help writing the changelog text, see the log and/or diffs, using one of:

    git log --name-status v`cat VERSION`..HEAD
    git diff v`cat VERSION`...HEAD

Also view the diffs to file index.html in the gh-pages branch.
(It doesn't have version tags, so this isn't entirely trivial; I should write
up the instructions here.)

6. Commit and push the changes in your copy of the plume-lib repository.

    git push

7. Wait about 2.5 hours and ensure that Travis and Jenkins jobs pass:
at least plume-lib, plume-lib-typecheck, daikon, and daikon-typecheck.
The following commands will open the URLs in your browser.

    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/mernst/plume-lib
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/codespecs/daikon
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/typetools/plume-lib-typecheck
    xdg-open https://travis-ci.org/typetools/daikon-typecheck
    xdg-open http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/job/plume-lib/
    xdg-open http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/job/daikon/
    xdg-open http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/job/plume-lib-typecheck/
    xdg-open http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/job/daikon-typecheck/

8. Run the make-plume-release script located in bin:

    export JAVAC=$CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin-devel/javac
    bin/make-plume-release `cat VERSION`

The script requires that $JAVAC or 'javac' point to the JSR 308 compiler.
If this is the case, then the release is built and the test cases are run.
The release will be compatible with Java 7.

9. Push the new Git tag created by the script to the repository:

    git push --tags

10. Make a new release on GitHub.
The exact steps are displayed at the end of the make-plume-release script. They
are repeated below, but you must replace x.y.z with the correct version number.
 * browse to https://github.com/mernst/plume-lib/releases/new
 * set tag to vx.y.z
 * Name is: plume-lib version x.y.z
 * description from changelog.txt, with line breaks fixed
 * attach plume-lib-x.y.z.tar.gz

11. Update the web version of the Javadoc.  On a machine connected to the UW
CSE file system:

    cd plume-lib/java
    git pull
    make javadoc-publish
    $pl/bin/checklink -q -r `grep -v '^#' $pl/bin/checklink-args.txt` http://types.cs.washington.edu/plume-lib/

This step can be done even without making a new release.
