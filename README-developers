This readme is intended for plume-lib developers.


--Making a release--

To make a plume-lib release, run the make-plume-release script located in
plume-lib/bin:

    make-plume-release x.y.z

where x.y.z is the intended new version number of the release.  The script
checks that there are no uncommitted and no unpushed changes before making a
release.

Note that the script does NOT build plume-lib or run the test cases; you are
expected to this before making a release.

If the script finds googlecode_upload.py [1] in your PATH, you will
be prompted to enter your Google Code username and password so artifacts
generated by the release can be uploaded to Google Code automatically.

Check that the artifacts were successfully uploaded to Google Code, or upload
them manually if not using googlecode_upload.py.  Remove the Featured label
from the previous release downloads in Google Code and reapply the label to the
new downloads.
