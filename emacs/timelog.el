;;; Timelog

;; This is a very primitive time logging system; it works for me, but is
;; not guaranteed to work for you.  It should probably be generalized,
;; better documented, etc.
;; (In Emacs 21.2, timeclock.el gave me errors, and isn't really what I want.)

;; There are two commands:
;;  M-x timelog   causes you to edit your timelog file
;;  M-x timelog-summarize   summarizes the timelog entries in the current region

;; The timelog file contains newline-separated entries of the following form:
;;
;;  1/5
;;  0800-1015 S review paper for EMSE
;;  1015-1145 R work on bug in MergeESC; fixed problem with VarInfoName lookup
;;  1145-1230 R fix problem with ESC output (equalities all on one line)
;;  1300-1330 R update to JUnit 3.8.1: "assert()" becomes "assertTrue()"
;;  1430-1445 A Stephen McCamant
;;  1530-1600 R testing of changes
;;
;; A date starts the paragraph.
;; The first column is a range of times, in military (24-hour) style.
;;   These times must be rounded to the nearest quarter hour.
;; The second column is a single letter indicating what I spent that time on:
;;   research, advising, education, service, logistics, or miscellaneous.
;; The final column is what I spent the time on.
;; The timelog-summarize command adds up all the time for each category, so
;;   you can see how much time you spent on (say) service in the last (say) week.
