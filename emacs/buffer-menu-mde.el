;; buffer-menu-mde.el -- enhancements to buffer-menu

;;; Commentary:

;; This file enhances the buffer-menu command in several ways:
;;  * marks uninteresting buffers unmodified
;;  * abbreviates file names:
;;     * it uses "~" instead of the full home directory pathname,
;;     * it permits arbitrary other replacements
;;  * omits temporary buffers
;;  * erases the read-only marks, which I find distracting
;;  * puts the cursor in the buffer-menu
;;  * updates the "*Buffer List*" buffer whenever `save-some-buffers' executes

;; To use, add to your .emacs:
;;   (eval-after-load "buff-menu" (load "buffer-menu-mde"))
;; You may also wish to set some of the variables that appear in this file.



;;; Code:

(provide 'buffer-menu-mde)

(defvar debug-buffer-menu-mde t)

;;;
;;; Unbind very dangerous keystroke that's too easy to type
;;;

;; was:  (define-key Buffer-menu-mode-map "g" 'Buffer-menu-revert)
