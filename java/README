This package, plume, is intended to supplement java.util.
It provides general functionality, not specific to any particular client.

For documentation, please see
  http://plume-lib.googlecode.com/hg/README.html#Java_libraries
or file ../README.html .


A note about licenses, which augments the main text in ../docs/LICENSE.txt :

This package includes modified versions of code from the Java 2 SDK, such
as those for hashing.  (I've renamed classes so they won't be used
accidentally and won't conflict with other classes of the same name.)
My understanding of the Java 2 SDK License is:
  * I can distribute modified executables to anyone for
    research use.  [3.1 (d) (ii)]
  * I can distribute modified source to other licensees (only).
    [3.1 (d) (i)]
  * I can re-use the JDK's names if I choose, but only for modified
    versions of the original code of those names.  [3.1 (d) (iii)]

I have tried a few times to update WeakHasherMap to a more recent version
of the JDK (which has a different license), but failed.  It should probably
be left as is.  Or, use guava, which offers similar functionality.  This
doesn't actually solve the licensing problem:  guava is licensed under the
Apache License 2.0 and thus strictly speaking could not be used with any
project that uses the GPL.
