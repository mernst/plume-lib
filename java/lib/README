These libraries are included in plume-lib and in the plume.jar file in
order to make plume-lib self-contained.  (They do make it large, though.)

Most libraries are standard, downloaded from their respective webpages.

checker-qual.jar is from the Checker Framework:
https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/releases

Two libraries are nonstandard:

BCEL (bcel.jar)
- Java class file reader/writer
- Git repository: https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel.git
- contains type annotations compared to upstream repository at
  https://github.com/codespecs/commons-bcel, which contains a bug fix compared
  to its upstream repository at https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel
- to build (must be done using JDK 7, not JDK 8):
    git clone https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel.git
    cd commons-bcel
    git pull https://github.com/codespecs/commons-bcel.git
    # Now, resolve any conflicts before running the next command.
    git push
    # The below command uses the the current Checker Framework from the
    # version control repository.  To use a released version of the
    # Checker Framework, update lines in pom.xml such as
    #    <version>1.9.13</version>
    # and instead run:  mvn clean verify
    mvn clean verify -P checkeframework-local
    \cp -pf target/commons-bcel6-6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ../bcel.jar
    cd ..
    rm -rf commons-bcel

svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar: for use by MultiVersionControl program
To create the file, I ran the following commands:
  cd ~/tmp
  wget http://www.svnkit.com/org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip
  unzip org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip
  cd svnkit-1.8.10/lib
  mkdir jar-contents
  cd jar-contents
  for file in ../*.jar; do
    jar xf $file;
  done
  find * -type f | $pl/bin/sort-directory-order > jar-contents.txt
  jar cf ../svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar @jar-contents.txt
  cd ..
  /rm -rf jar-contents
  mv svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar $pl/java/lib
  cd ~/tmp
  \rm -rf org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip svnkit-1.8.10
