These libraries are included in plume-lib and in the plume.jar file in
order to make plume-lib self-contained.  (They do make it large, though.)

Most libraries are standard, downloaded from their respective webpages.

Two are nonstandard:

BCEL 5.2+ (bcel.jar)
- java class file reader/writer
- many local changes to support StackMaps and Java8
- detailed history in history-bcel.txt (in the repo)
- Mercurial repository: /projects/swlab1/bcel/bcel-java7
- to build: mvn verify
- result is target/bcel-java7-SNAPSHOT.jar
- copy to this directory and rename bcel.jar

svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar: for use by MultiVersionControl program
To create the file, I ran the following commands:
  cd ~/tmp
  wget http://www.svnkit.com/org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip
  unzip org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip
  cd svnkit-1.8.10/lib
  mkdir jar-contents
  cd jar-contents
  for file in ../*.jar; do
    jar xf $file;
  done
  find * -type f | $pl/bin/sort-directory-order > jar-contents.txt
  jar cf ../svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar @jar-contents.txt
  cd ..
  /rm -rf jar-contents
  mv svnkit-1.8.10-complete.jar $pl/java/lib
  cd ~/tmp
  \rm -rf org.tmatesoft.svn_1.8.10.standalone.zip svnkit-1.8.10
